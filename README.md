# challenge-1-refactoring
Module one challenge

# **Description**

In this weeks challenge I was given existing HTML and CSS files.  I worked to refactor the HTML using semantic language.  Alternate image descriptions were added for accessibility.  The CSS was consolidated and re-ordered to match the web page flow.
